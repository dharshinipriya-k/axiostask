React Data fetch using Axios:

    Created an project in which user data is fetched by interacting with the mock.api in order to display and perform crud operations.

    The application contains components like Home page to display all the user details 
    (Route by using: '/')

    User can create data by entering user info by navigating to create user page(' /create-user ')

    Once the data has been submitted it is updated in the api and the app automatically navigate to dashboard page (' /dashboard ')

    Dashboard is the page where we can either approve or reject the user.

    Only the approved user data will be displayed in the home page.

    The user can also edit info by clicking the edit user button which will navigate to (' /edit-user/id ')

    There is also an feature to delete the data.
